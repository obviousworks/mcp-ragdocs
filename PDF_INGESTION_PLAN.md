# PDF Ingestion Support Implementation Plan

## Goal
Enable the MCP RagDocs server to fetch, parse, chunk, embed, and index PDF documents (from URLs, and eventually local files) as first-class citizens alongside HTML/text sources.

## Design Principles
- Simplicity First ([SF])
- Dependency Minimalism ([DM])
- Readability Priority ([RP])
- Clean Architecture ([CA])
- Robust Error Handling ([REH])
- Performance Awareness ([PA])
- Input Validation ([IV])
- Constants Over Magic Values ([CMV])
- Test-Driven Thinking ([TDT])

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design PDF ingestion workflow**
2. **Integrate `pdf-parse` and implement PDF text extraction**
3. **Add chunking logic for PDFs**
4. **Store PDF metadata in Qdrant**
5. **Update tool descriptions and README**
6. **Add tests for PDF ingestion and error cases**

## Tasks/TODOs
- [ ] Detect PDF URLs/content-type in ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Download PDF as buffer
- [ ] Parse PDF to extract text and metadata
- [ ] Chunk PDF text efficiently (respecting page breaks)
- [ ] Generate embeddings and upsert chunks into Qdrant
- [ ] Store relevant PDF metadata (title, author, page number, etc.)
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully and report clear messages
- [ ] Update documentation and tool descriptions
- [ ] Add unit/integration tests for PDF ingestion

## Notes
- Consider future support for DOCX, Markdown, etc. by abstracting ingestion logic.
- Use only one PDF parsing library, prefer `pdf-parse` for simplicity.
- Ensure all new code is testable and follows project coding standards.
